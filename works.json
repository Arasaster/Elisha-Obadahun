The keywords were: playful, modern, and high-tech and font specificity - a blocky, digital font. Quanta is an education tech brand, they build a fun, easy and engaging way to learn about a complex topic.",

So using this piece of information, I extracted the shape of an atom - as 6 circles outline in 3D space. made it 2D in orthographic projection. then the center poligon is supposed to be an education hat.
